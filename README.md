# 🛠️ Database Operations Application 🌐

This project demonstrates a complete implementation of a web application that interacts with a **Microsoft SQL Server** database using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Tedious**. The application provides dynamic operations for managing goods, sales, and workers while showcasing a modern user interface built with **Tailwind CSS**.

## 🚀 Features

1. **RESTful API Integration**:
   - Retrieve all goods from the database.
   - Execute SQL Server functions to fetch the largest order and top-selling goods.
   - Execute stored procedures to update goods information dynamically.
   
2. **User Interface**:
   - Dynamic rendering of goods and sales data.
   - Intuitive and responsive design with **Tailwind CSS**.
   - Interactive procedure execution with real-time updates.

3. **SQL Server Integration**:
   - Connects seamlessly to **Microsoft SQL Server** using the **Tedious** library.
   - Executes complex stored procedures and functions with parameterized queries.

4. **Scalability**:
   - Built with **Express.js** for a scalable backend.
   - Modular architecture for easy extension and maintenance.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, Tedious
- **Frontend**: HTML, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript
